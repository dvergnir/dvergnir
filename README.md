### Hi there :bowtie:

My name is Benjamin 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Him | He

I live right outside Bergen, Norway. My interests are cooking, fishing, hiking, gardening, foraging and gaming.

I am a fresh Front-End Developer graduating October 2023 from Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media.
I have 5 years of experience from ATEA Norge, where I got my Certificate of Apprenticeship in Computer Electronics in 2016.
I worked with software, hardware, CCTV, IP-networks and some customer support.
After I got my Certificate I started working as a professional brewer, while simultaneously opening the first meadery in Norway, MjÃ¸deriet.
I worked as a Production Manager and General Manager until Covid hit in 2020. That is when I decided to go back to my roots in IT and learn
Web Development.

What triggers my curiosity most in web technologies are UX, machine learning and AI.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a wordpress website for a local marina.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently getting more experience with React and webhosting, and will be looking into MUI and Tailwind next.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Mead is most likely the oldest alcoholic beverage known to man
