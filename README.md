### Hi there :bowtie:

My name is Benjamin 
- 😄 Pronouns: Him | He

I live right outside Bergen, Norway. My interests are cooking, fishing, hiking, gardening, foraging and gaming.

I am a Front-End Developer student at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media, and I am currently in the last semester about to finish this 2yr course.
I have 5 years of experience from ATEA Norge, where I got my Certificate of Apprenticeship in Computer Electronics in 2016.
I worked with software, hardware, CCTV, IP-networks and some customer support.
After I got my Certificate I started working as a professional brewer, while simultaneously opening the first meadery in Norway, Mjøderiet.
I worked as a Production Manager and General Manager until Covid hit in 2020. That is when I decided to go back to my roots in IT and learn
Web Development.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my final Project Exam
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript, Bootstrap and workflow
- ⚡ Fun fact: Mead is most likely the oldest alcoholic beverage known to man
