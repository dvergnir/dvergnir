### Hi there :bowtie:

My name is Benjamin 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Him | He

I live right outside Bergen, Norway. My interestes are cooking, fishing, hiking, gardening, foraging and gaming.

I am a Front-End Developer student at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media, and I am 
just now finishing my first out of 2 years at Noroff.
I have 5 years of experience from ATEA Norge, where I got my Certificate of Apprenticeship in Computer Electronics in 2016.
I worked with software, hardware, CCTV, IP-networks and some customer support.
After I got my certificate I started working as a professional brewer, while simultaneously starting the first meadery in Norway, MjÃ¸deriet.
I worked as a production manager and general manager until Covid hit in 2020. That is when I decided to go back to my roots in IT and learn
Web Development.
